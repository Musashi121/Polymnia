Some ideas:

You have to hire assist manager, cleaning crews, shop staff.
You have to purchase diff food and drink infrastructure ( hot dogs, popcorn, milkshakes)
You have to buy a series of movies, each with diff attributes like drawing power. etc
You start with just one screen, but can add up to 8, including 3 diff screen sizes? widescreen? 3D?
You can buy basic versions of 10 films, and widescreen versions of 4 or 5, which can only go on wide screens.
You have to buy up everything trying to become the number 1 cinema in town ( and get a boost of customers each time you get higher)
  At the start you are just named to top 25, top 20 etc. Eventually it becomes a top 10 count down. 
You have a board, rating you cleanliness, entertainment value of movies, screen availability - cheap options?
You can set ticket prices for adults, students and kids. Each movies draw is affetced by ticket prices.
  Each movie has diff draw power for each age group?



For future versions:

Your ass manager would be able to advise you if you can show a film more often and still fill the seats you have etc ( hidden from player).
Movies would go through 4 diff seasons, with your cinema ranking being updated at the end of each.
  Each season, a raft of new movies comes out.
  You would have to become numbr 1 in 3 years, and I could plan out movies for each season.
Diff screens could have diff construction times.
